# The default configuration for sudo includes the following directive:
#
#   #includedir /etc/sudoers.d
# 
# This will cause sudo to read and parse any files in the /etc/sudoers.d 
# directory that do not end in '~' or contain a '.' character.
# 
# Note that there must be at least one file in the sudoers.d directory
# (this one will do), and all files in this directory should be mode
# 0440.
